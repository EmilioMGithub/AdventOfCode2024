# 🎄 Advent of Code 2024 🎄

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2024** solutions repository! 🎅🦌 This is where I tackled each daily coding challenge with enthusiasm, sleep deprivation, and some Python 🐍.

## 🚀 About the Project

Advent of Code is a series of daily coding challenges every December. I participated this year for fun, focusing on solving the problems quickly 🕒 rather than writing the most efficient code. **Speed over elegance** was the name of the game, but hey—sometimes a dash of creativity snuck in. 😉

### 🌟 Highlights
- **Language**: Python (because it is easy, and I wanted some pratice)
- **Goal**: Solve problems fast (efficiency was optional... most of the time).
- **Mood**: Festive and chaotic while slightly competive with friends 🎉

## 🛠️ How It Works

Each day brings a new problem, and I’ve uploaded my solutions for each day in a folder title day[that day].
Feel free to check out the code, but don’t expect good quality here. Think more “he did this while sleep deprived” 😴

To run any solution, just run the python file
